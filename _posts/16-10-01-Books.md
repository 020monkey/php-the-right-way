## 书籍 {#books_title}

市面上有很多关于 PHP 的书，但遗憾的是很多都已经非常陈旧而且不正确的资料。甚至还有出版商发布「 PHP 6 」， a version that will now never exist. The next major release of PHP after 5.6 was "PHP 7", [partly because of this](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/php6).

这个章节的目录主要是针对 PHP 开发，并且会随着最新的技术趋势而更新。如果你想在这里加入你的书，请发送一个 PR ，我们将会审查你提供的内容是否有相关性。
