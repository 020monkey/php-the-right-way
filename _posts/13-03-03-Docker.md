## Docker {#docker_title}

Beside using Vagrant, another easy way to get a virtual development or production environment up and running is [Docker][docker].  
Docker helps you to provide Linux containers for all kind of applications. 
There are many helpful docker images that could provide you with other great services without the need to install
these services on your local machine, e.g. MySQL or PostgreSQL and a lot more.
Have a look at the [Docker Hub Registry][docker-hub] to search a list of available pre-built containers,
that you can then run and use in very few steps.

### Example: Runnning your PHP Applications in Docker
After you [installed docker][docker-install] on your machine, you can start an Apache with PHP support in one step.  
The following command will download a fully functional Apache installation with the latest PHP version and provide the
directory `/path/to/your/php/files` at `http://localhost:8080`:

{% highlight bash %}
docker run -d --name my-php-webserver -p 8080:80 -v /path/to/your/php/files:/var/www/html/ php:apache 
{% endhighlight %}
