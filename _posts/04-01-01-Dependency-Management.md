# Dependency Management {#dependency_management_title}

There are a ton of PHP libraries, frameworks, and components to choose from. Your project will likely use several of them â€” these are project dependencies. Until recently, PHP did not have a good way to manage these project dependencies. Even if you managed them manually, you still had to worry about autoloaders. No more.

Currently there are two major package management systems for PHP - Composer and PEAR. The former is the main package manager to use for PHP, however for a long time PEAR used to fill that role, and you may still find references to it so it's a good idea to be aware of its extistence too.
