## Books {#books_title}

There are a lot of books around for PHP but some are sadly now quite old and no
longer contain accurate information. There are even books published for "PHP 6"
which does not exist, any might not now ever exist because of those books. 

This section aims to be a living document for recommended books on PHP
development in general. If you would like your book to be added, send a PR and
it will be reviewed for relevancy.
